# Day 3: Is Your Customer Data Safe?

**Subject Line:** A data breach could kill your business. Seriously.

**Pre-header:** Is your Privacy Policy compliant with Australian law? Fines are steep.

**Body Copy:**

Hi [Name],

Let's talk about something that can silently kill your business: a data breach.

It’s not just about angry customers. Under the Australian Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme, failing to secure customer data can result in fines up to **$2.1 million** for companies.

Can your business survive that? 

A generic, copy-pasted privacy policy won’t cut it. You need a policy that reflects how *your* business handles data, is crystal clear to your customers, and meets strict Australian Privacy Principles.

Legally Legit AI can create a legally-sound, ACCC-compliant Privacy Policy tailored to your specific business operations in just a few clicks. Don't leave your business exposed to crippling fines and irreversible reputational damage.
