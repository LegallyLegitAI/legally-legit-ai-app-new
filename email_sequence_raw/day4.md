# Day 4: Website T&Cs - Your First Line of Defense

**Subject Line:** Your website T&Cs might be worthless...

**Pre-header:** Avoid costly disputes and protect your business with legally sound T&Cs.

**Body Copy:**

Hey [Name],

Think your website's Terms and Conditions have you covered? Think again.

Many small businesses use generic templates that are either not tailored to their specific services or aren't compliant with Australian Consumer Law. This leaves you wide open to disputes over payments, refunds, and service delivery.

Without iron-clad T&Cs, you could be forced to issue refunds you canâ€™t afford, or worse, end up in a drawn-out, expensive legal battle. The ACCC doesn't mess around with businesses that have unfair contract terms.

Your T&Cs are your first line of defense. Let Legally Legit AI build you a set that protects your revenue and your reputation.
