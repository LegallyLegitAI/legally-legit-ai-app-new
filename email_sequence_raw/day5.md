Hi [Name],

Cash flow problems kill more small businesses than anything else.

And here's what most business owners don't realize: your contracts are your cash flow insurance policy. Weak contracts mean late payments, unpaid invoices, and scope creep that eats your profit margins alive.

Strong, legally-enforceable contracts mean:
- Clear payment terms with penalties for late payment
- Defined scope to prevent endless revisions
- Protection against difficult clients who try to weasel out of paying

Without proper contracts, you're essentially working on good faith and a handshake. That's not a business strategy â€“ it's a recipe for bankruptcy.
