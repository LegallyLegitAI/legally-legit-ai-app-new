Hey [Name],

Yesterday, I mentioned the #1 compliance mistake that trips up Australian small businesses. Here it is:

**Misclassifying employees as independent contractors.**

It seems like a simple way to save on payroll tax and super, but the Fair Work Ombudsman can hit you with penalties up to $13,320 per violation if you get it wrong.

And that's before back-paying years of entitlements.
