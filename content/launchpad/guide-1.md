## Step 2: Register for an ABN

An Australian Business Number (ABN) is essential for most businesses:

- Operating any kind of business enterprise

## Step 3: Register Your Business Name

If you're not using your own name, you'll need to register a business name:

1. **Search for availability** on the ASIC Connect website
2. **Complete the application** - costs $44 for 1 year or $102 for 3 years
3. **Provide required information** about your business and contact details
4. **Renew before expiry** to maintain your rights to the name

## Step 4: Company Registration (If Required)

For companies, you'll need to register with ASIC:

2. **Complete Form 201** online through ASIC Connect
3. **Pay the registration fee** - currently $540
4. **Receive your ACN** and Certificate of Registration
5. **Set up company records** including registers and minute books

## Step 5: Tax Registration

### GST Registration
Register for GST if:
- Annual turnover is $75,000 or more

### PAYG Withholding
Required if you have employees or pay contractors without ABNs.

### Other Tax Obligations

- **Construction**: Building licenses from state authorities
- **Financial services**: AFSL from ASIC
- **Healthcare**: Registration with relevant professional bodies

## Step 7: Insurance and Compliance

### Ongoing Compliance
- Annual ASIC statements for companies
